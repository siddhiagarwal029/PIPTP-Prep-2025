### Problem 2:
```python
Integer a
Set a=1
while(a<5)
       a=a+2
end while
Print a
```
### Approach:
---
here the loop executes till we get the value of a > or equal to 5. And by excuting the code we get it running twice first we get the value of a=3 then in second iteration it updates to 5 which is equal to 5, here the loop ends.
