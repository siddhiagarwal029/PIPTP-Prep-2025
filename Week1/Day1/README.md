# Week1 - Day 1

## Problems
### Problem 1:
---
```python
def fun(w, x):
    y = 0
    if (x % w == 0) or (w % x == 0):
        y = y + 1
    else:
        y = y + 10
    return y

print(fun(40, 4))
```
### Approach:
---
Uses % operator and find if x%w is equals to 0 or w%x is equals to zero. If one of the condition true then print 1 or else print 10.

### Solution:

### Problem 2:
---
```python
Integer a
Set a=1
while(a<5)
       a=a+2
end while
Print a
```
### Approach:
---
here the loop executes till we get the value of a > or equal to 5. And by excuting the code we get it running twice first we get the value of a=3 then in second iteration it updates to 5 which is equal to 5, here the loop ends.
### Solution:
