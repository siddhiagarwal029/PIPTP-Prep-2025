## Problems
### Problem 1:
---
  def fun(w,x):
    y=0
    if((x%w==0) or (w%x)==0):
      y=y+1
    else:
      y=y+10
    print(y)
  print(fun(40,4))

### Approach:
---
Uses % operator and find if x%w is equals to 0 or w%x is equals to zero. If one of the condition true then print 1 or else print 10.
